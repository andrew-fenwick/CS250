The users needs should be the most essential factor in decision making and development of a program.
User stories helps to get the input from users to help an organization gain the required understanding of what consumers really want.
These stories all for an authentic, unbiased perspective on where a project should be going. When developing programs, it is important to possess flexibility while presenting transparency.
The agile process encapsulates both of those aspects. Proper communication and collaboration with fellow members of a scrum or sprint can help ensure that a team is on track and each member is doing their part.
In order to be a good team member, it requires honesty, a good work ethic and the ability to take criticism and make required adjustments to improve how you program.
